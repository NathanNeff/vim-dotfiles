# vim-dotfiles

These are my vim dotfiles.  There are many like
them, but these are mine.

## Installation / Bootstrap

TL;DR The plugins I use are *not* part of this Git repository
(not even as submodules).

Therefore, in order to exactly replicate the functionality
in these vim-dotfiles you need to:

```bash
cd ~/.vimrc
mkdir bundle
cd bundle
git clone https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen.git
```

See "Can I put pathogen.vim in a submodule like all my other plugins?" section
of https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen
